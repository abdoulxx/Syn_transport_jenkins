La cause originelle est que les fonctionnalités de l'application sont appelées à l'aide d'URL ou d'actions de formulaires prévisibles et reproductibles. La nature de l'attaque est que le CSRF exploite la confiance qu'un site internet accorde à un utilisateur. En revanche, le cross-site scripting (XSS) exploite la confiance que l'utilisateur porte à un site internet. Comme XSS, les attaques CSRF ne sont pas nécessairement multi-sites, mais elles peuvent l'être. La contrefaçon de requête intersite est également connue sous les noms CSRF, XSRF, attaque en un clic (one-click attack), session riding, confused deputy et sea surf.\n\nLes attaques CSRF sont efficaces dans de nombreuses situations, notamment:\n* quand la victime a une session active sur le site cible.\n    * quand la victime est authentifiée via HTTP auth sur le site cible.\n    * quand la victime est sur le même réseau local que le site cible.\n\nCSRF a d'abord été utilisée pour effectuer une action contre un site cible en utilisant les privilèges de la victime, mais des techniques récentes permettent d'avoir accès à des renseignements en accédant à la réponse. Le risque de divulgation d'informations est considérablement augmenté lorsque le site cible est vulnérable aux XSS, parce que XSS peut être utilisé comme une plateforme pour CSRF, permettant à l'attaque d'opérer dans les limites de la politique de même origine.",
