La cause originelle est que les fonctionnalitÃ©s de l'application sont appelÃ©es Ã  l'aide d'URL ou d'actions de formulaires prÃ©visibles et reproductibles. La nature de l'attaque est que le CSRF exploite la confiance qu'un site internet accorde Ã  un utilisateur. En revanche, le cross-site scripting (XSS) exploite la confiance que l'utilisateur porte Ã  un site internet. Comme XSS, les attaques CSRF ne sont pas nÃ©cessairement multi-sites, mais elles peuvent l'Ãªtre. La contrefaÃ§on de requÃªte intersite est Ã©galement connue sous les noms CSRF, XSRF, attaque en un clic (one-click attack), session riding, confused deputy et sea surf.\n\nLes attaques CSRF sont efficaces dans de nombreuses situations, notamment:\n* quand la victime a une session active sur le site cible.\n    * quand la victime est authentifiÃ©e via HTTP auth sur le site cible.\n    * quand la victime est sur le mÃªme rÃ©seau local que le site cible.\n\nCSRF a d'abord Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©e pour effectuer une action contre un site cible en utilisant les privilÃ¨ges de la victime, mais des techniques rÃ©centes permettent d'avoir accÃ¨s Ã  des renseignements en accÃ©dant Ã  la rÃ©ponse. Le risque de divulgation d'informations est considÃ©rablement augmentÃ© lorsque le site cible est vulnÃ©rable aux XSS, parce que XSS peut Ãªtre utilisÃ© comme une plateforme pour CSRF, permettant Ã  l'attaque d'opÃ©rer dans les limites de la politique de mÃªme origine.",
